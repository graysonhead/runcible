Getting Started
===============

Currently, the only part of Runcible that is usable at this stage is the device level API.

If you have access to a Cumulus device (or a Cumulus virtual appliance, which can be downloaded for free and run within
Vagrant, KVM-QEMU, or GNS3), you can follow the steps below to give the Device API a spin.

.. Note::
    If you are considering contributing to Runcible, it is highly encouraged to download and familiarize yourself with
    GNS3, as it makes testing actions performed against a topology of virtual switches much easier.

First, install runcible.
