Current State of Runcible
--------------------------------------

Runcible is very early in it's devleopment; however our goal is to provide a full layer of functionality at
a time, which means it might be useful for certian tasks long before development is complete. It's also a great time to
get involved, as your input will shape the direction and structure of the project.
