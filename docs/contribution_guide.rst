Current State of Runcible
--------------------------------------

Runcible is very early in it's devleopment; however our goal is to provide a full layer of functionality at
a time, which means it might be useful for certian tasks long before development is complete. It's also a great time to
get involved, as your input will shape the direction and structure of the project.

During the early stages of development, the most up to date information should be found in the :ref:`getting-started`
guide.
